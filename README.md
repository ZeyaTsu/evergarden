# Evergarden
## A basic application that lets you download images from specific anime & character.
### Under GNU GPLv3.0 License.

Open-Source project, feel free to commit new features so I can add them in a next version. <br/>
<br/>
And no, Evergarden isn't a virus. Those are false-positives due to compiling a .py file to .exe using pyinstaller. <br/>
If you don't want to run the .exe file, you can still download the .py file located in the 'src' folder.
